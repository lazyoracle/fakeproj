fakeproj: DevOps for Dummies
======================================

This documentation is intended to serve as a self-paced tutorial to familiarise Python developers with various tools 
that can help them develop, maintain and publish better code while making the experience a lot more enjoyable. The repository
contains sample files that demonstrate all the functionality that we discuss in this tutorial. Ideally, one should start from
an empty repository and follow along the various sections below to write code, documentation & tests and then configure the build
and deployment systems, referring to the sample code whenever necessary.
